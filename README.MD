# The Rollercoaster Ticket Machine

This code assist on calculating the tickets cost based on the customers age and their wish to take photo during the ride or not. 

I have used `if`, `elif` annd `else` conditional statements to lay out the selection of ticket categories based on the age and this will automatically result in the tickt price calculation.
